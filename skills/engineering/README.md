# Engineering

Skills I use daily for code work.

## User-invoked

Reachable only when you type them (Claude Code: `disable-model-invocation: true`; Codex: `policy.allow_implicit_invocation: false` in `agents/openai.yaml`).

- **[ask-matt](./ask-matt/SKILL.md)**: Ask which skill or flow fits your situation. A router over the user-invoked skills in this repo.
- **[grill-with-docs](./grill-with-docs/SKILL.md)**: Grilling session that also builds your project's domain model, sharpening terminology and updating `CONTEXT.md` and ADRs inline.
- **[triage](./triage/SKILL.md)**: Move issues through a state machine of triage roles.
- **[improve-codebase-architecture](./improve-codebase-architecture/SKILL.md)**: Scan a codebase for deepening opportunities, present them as a visual HTML report, then grill through whichever one you pick.
- **[setup-matt-pocock-skills](./setup-matt-pocock-skills/SKILL.md)**: Configure this repo for the engineering skills (issue tracker, triage labels, domain doc layout). Run once per repo.
- **[to-spec](./to-spec/SKILL.md)**: Turn the current conversation into a spec and publish it to the issue tracker.
- **[to-tickets](./to-tickets/SKILL.md)**: Break any plan, spec, or conversation into a set of tracer-bullet tickets, each declaring its blocking edges, whether as text in a local file or as native blocking links on a real tracker.
- **[implement](./implement/SKILL.md)**: Build the work described by a spec or set of tickets, driving `/tdd` at pre-agreed seams and closing out with `/code-review` before committing.
- **[wayfinder](./wayfinder/SKILL.md)**: Plan a huge chunk of work (more than one agent session can hold) as a shared map of decision tickets on the issue tracker, resolved one at a time until the way to the destination is clear.

## Model-invoked

Model- or user-reachable (rich trigger phrasing so the model can reach for them).

- **[prototype](./prototype/SKILL.md)**: Build a throwaway prototype to answer a design question: a single shareable HTML file for state/logic, or several toggleable UI variations.

- **[diagnosing-bugs](./diagnosing-bugs/SKILL.md)**: Disciplined diagnosis loop for hard bugs and performance regressions: build a feedback loop that goes red on this bug → minimise → hypothesise → instrument → fix → regression-test.
- **[research](./research/SKILL.md)**: Investigate a question against high-trust primary sources and capture the findings as a cited Markdown file in the repo, run as a background agent.
- **[tdd](./tdd/SKILL.md)**: Test-driven development with a red-green-refactor loop. Builds features or fixes bugs one vertical slice at a time.
- **[domain-modeling](./domain-modeling/SKILL.md)**: Actively build and sharpen a project's domain model by challenging terms, stress-testing with scenarios, and updating `CONTEXT.md` and ADRs inline.
- **[codebase-design](./codebase-design/SKILL.md)**: Shared discipline and vocabulary for designing deep modules: small interfaces, clean seams, testable through the interface.
- **[code-review](./code-review/SKILL.md)**: Two-axis review of the diff since a fixed point: **Standards** (does it follow the repo's coding standards, plus a Fowler smell baseline?) and **Spec** (does it faithfully implement the originating issue/spec?), run as parallel sub-agents.
- **[resolving-merge-conflicts](./resolving-merge-conflicts/SKILL.md)**: Work through an in-progress git merge or rebase conflict hunk by hunk, resolving by intent traced to each side's primary source, then finish the operation, never `--abort`.
- **[wizard](./wizard/SKILL.md)**: Generate an interactive bash wizard that walks a human through steps only they can perform: provisioning infrastructure, setting up credentials or CI secrets, walking an unfamiliar third-party dashboard, or running a one-off migration or cutover.
- **[ux-design](./ux-design/SKILL.md)**: Design the user experience from the spec (goals, information architecture, primary and alternative flows, system states, accessibility) and hand `ui-design` a screen/state map.
- **[ui-design](./ui-design/SKILL.md)**: Turn a validated UX into an implementation-ready visual design system: hierarchy, typography and spacing, reusable components, responsive rules, component states, and design tokens.
- **[design-system](./design-system/SKILL.md)**: Own the visual rules between `ui-design` and `prototype`: semantic colour roles, type and spacing scales, component states, accessibility, and implementation-ready design tokens, kept as the single source of truth.
- **[test](./test/SKILL.md)**: Validate a change against its acceptance criteria across happy path, failure and edge cases, then check for regressions before it reaches review.
- **[experiment](./experiment/SKILL.md)**: Run a controlled loop (hypothesis, change, run, measure, compare, keep/reject, record) to decide between alternatives from measured evidence rather than guesswork.
